# diep-bot
A diep.io bot made in node.js

Uses a library called puppeteer made by Google.

I need help making it, so if you can find a way to use computer vision to find enemies and bullets, please submit a pull request! Help would be greatly appreciated.

## Install

```
npm install -g git+https://github.com/TheGreatRambler/diep%2Dbot.git
```
